# Notes 

### Disclaimer - i put more notes in recursive.py as it was easier for me to make notes as writing the code 

- In this class it is required to write a docstring for every function we make 
- modulo % gives remainder
- // is float division (no decimal point)


I experimented with the material and tried to take it a bit further in my code in s05.py as well as in the recursive script. 

I realized I am logged into github for copilot with my LSE account, so i need to log out to access copilot here on vscode
