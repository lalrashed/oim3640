# Notes 

### Disclaimer - i put more notes in recursive.py as it was easier for me to make notes as writing the code 

- In this class it is required to write a docstring for every function we make 
- modulo % gives remainder
- // is float division (no decimal point)


I experimented with the material and tried to take it a bit further in my code in s05.py as well as in the recursive script. 

I realized I am logged into github for copilot with my LSE account, so i need to log out to access copilot here on vscode 

### Questions 
- Do you build classes in python in the same way you do in java? do they serve a similar purpose? 
    - i considered this doing the ch.3 spam song exercise. If I were writing this in java, I would just make a class with the parameters for the chours, riff, additional verses, etc. and have the functions within the same class for building out a song with any lyrics (no hard coding print lines where possible). I don't know if this is necessary or efficient, but it's where my mind went.
