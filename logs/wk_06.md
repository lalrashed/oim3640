# Week 4 2/10 + 2/12

# HW - 
- mini project

## Class Takeaways
- return ends functions and iterations in loops 
- break and continue interrupt loops. Break exits the loop while continue skips the iteration. 


## What I learned 
- i learned if return is triggered in an if statement that is witihin a for loop, it will only go over one iteration
## Code I'm Proud of 
- Mini project 1 - Meowtal combat! 
## Challenges 
## Questions 
- Deadline for the miniproject? I didn't recieve feedback on my proposal.
