## What i learned in class
- I learned that when slicing a string you can go out of order and it will stil follow the order.  ex. string [1:6:2] will return the letters of the string in the chronological orer. 
- \ is called escape char formally
- can use python tutor.com to visualize code ( bluejay had something similar to this, I used it in highschool)
- you can type an emoji with windows key+period
- control+ shift + v shortcut to markdown preview 

## what i learned from the notebooks
- I have worked with the turtle in high school AP CSP 
- working code and reorganizing it with different functions(improve the code without changing its behavior) is called refactoring.
