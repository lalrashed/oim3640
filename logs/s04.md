I learned you could run .py files directly in the terminal by calling "python file.py ". 
control enter will run and stay, shift enter will take you to next block

- jupyter notebooks display output but python does not
- i leared you could execute code also by calling python in terminal (effectively opening python power shell)
- i learned that you can multiply strings with * #. i did not know that was possible before

I have taken previous coding classes so I was familiar with a lot of the content of the chapters already.
