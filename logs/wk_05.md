# Week 4 2/10 + 2/12

# HW - 
- mini project, do proposal and then start working on it 

## Class Takeaways
- return ends functions and iterations in loops 
- while loops are another form of iteration 


## What I learned 
- It was reinforced that return lines end the function. 
- if _name_ == "_main_" is the entery point of the code 
- breaks end while loops 
- continue means skip whatever's below it, moving on to the next round of interations
